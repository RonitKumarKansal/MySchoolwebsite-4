                        <p class="text-muted text-left">Books play an essential role in everyone’s life. It helps to expand our capabilities, to know more about things that interest us. A library is a place that solves this problem. Great books on various themes, genres, and subjects can be found in only one place. The books that we need can be borrowed, and when we are done reading it, we return them for someone else to take it home.

                            School Library is the place where kids are introduced to the magical world of books. Where they can read and know about anything, they want to know. It is common for school students to write essays on the topic of the School Library.</p>

                        <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked when I got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.

                        <p>Football is one of the most popular games in the world. It is also one of the oldest games. It is a game of strength and stamina. In terms of popularity, it is as popular as cricket. Comparatively, it is more popular in Europe and Latin America.

                            Last Sunday, I got an opportunity to witness a football match which was played between Khalsa Modern School and Central School, Nawagaon. The match was played at the playgrounds of Government Boys’ Higher Secondary School, Navinagan, and Nawagaon. The entire ground was well decorated and a large number of chairs were arranged for the guests and spectators. Both the teams were well-prepared and confident of their win. The ground was full packed. The match was to start at 1 p.m. Both the teams entered the ground on scheduled time. After the toss, the referee blew the whistle and the match began. It was expected to be a well-contested and lively match. Both the teams were expecting to score well. During the first few minutes, it was the Khalsa Modern School who dominated the match. They struck hard to the defenses of their rival, but failed to score any goal. However, they performed brilliantly and the spectators enjoyed the game.</p>

Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

                        Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.

                        <b>2. Economics</b>
                        Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.

                        <b> 3. Productivity / Efficiency</b>
                        Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
